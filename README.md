## Introduction
Welcome to my personal website, where I document my journey through learning web development with FreeCodeCamp. This website serves as my digital portfolio, containing all the notes, lessons, and activities I have undertaken during the past year of learning. Here, I share my progress, and projects as I delve into the fascinating world of web development.

## About Me
Iâ€™m a highly motivated and skilled aspiring developer with a passion forboth front-end and back-end development based in the Philippines sinceyear 2022. Committed to creating dynamic and user-friendly webapplications that optimize user experience. Eager to leverage technicalexpertise and continuous learning to contribute to a dynamic andinnovative development environment.

## My Learning Journey
I started my web development journey when I was a student, in a certain local school, with FreeCodeCamp, an amazing online platform that offers a structured and comprehensive curriculum. Here, I have covered a wide range of topics, from basic HTML and CSS to advanced JavaScript frameworks. Throughout my learning, I have built several projects that showcase my skills and understanding of web development concepts. After doing the first course, I proceed to do my On-the Job Training (OJT) together with 2 different developers under an international company that has an office or branch in the Philippines. There, I learn more deeply on the tools, technologies, practices, and etc. of those who are in web development. After that, I continue on doing some studies, or research regarding HTML, CSS, and JS. As I progress through my college studies, I proceed to do my thesis project which is a Digital Payment System, with the help of my team and mentors, we are able to pass the thesis and determine that there's a lot more to do when you have a project regarding a payment system. After being done with college and up to present, I still and would still continue on learning more and more about web development through the help of different websites, videos, and etc.
