## Introduction

Welcome to another website of mine. Viewers can see traces of my journey of learning web development. This mainly includes tools that can be of use to anyone on web development since it contains color palettes, font pairings, and even quick starts on front-end web technologies. However, this may be somehow incomplete since I've just started on year 2022.

## About Me

Iâ€™m a highly motivated and skilled aspiring developer with a passion for both front-end and back-end development based in the Philippines sinceyear 2022. Committed to creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications that optimize user experience. Eager to leverage technical expertise and continuous learning to contribute to a dynamic and innovative development environment.

## My Learning Journey

I started my web development journey when I was a student, in a certain local school, with FreeCodeCamp, an amazing online platform that offers a structured and comprehensive curriculum. Here, I have covered a wide range of topics, from basic HTML and CSS to advanced JavaScript frameworks. Throughout my learning, I have built several projects that showcase my skills and understanding of web development concepts. After doing the first course, I proceed to do my On-the Job Training (OJT) together with 2 different developers under an international company that has an office or branch in the Philippines. There, I learn more deeply on the tools, technologies, practices, and etc. of those who are in web development. After that, I continue on doing some studies, or research regarding HTML, CSS, and JS. As I progress through my college studies, I proceed to do my thesis project which is a Digital Payment System, with the help of my team and mentors, we are able to pass the thesis and determine that there's a lot more to do when you have a project regarding a payment system. After being done with college and up to present, I still and would still continue on learning more and more about web development through the help of different websites, videos, and etc.
